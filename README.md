## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
print("This is main.Py and HELLO!!!")
```

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
I have been confused on how to accually run a file on the metro 0 board for 2 weeks. I finally got it to run on my own by deleting all .py files but main.py, reset my board, and printed code on main.py. I still don't know exactly how it works as of 9/13/2021.
