## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
print("This is main.Py and HELLO!!!")
```

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
I have been confused on how to accually run a file on the metro 0 board for 2 weeks. I finally got it to run on my own by deleting all .py files but main.py, reset my board, and printed code on main.py. I still don't know exactly how it works as of 9/13/2021.


## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

print("working")

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
        print("moved")
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)

```
